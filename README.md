# Mosey
A free and open source bytecode obfuscator.

# Rewrite? What's new?
This rewrite's main purpose was to remove **all** dependencies that were not written by me.

But along with that the config system is much, much, better. Now configs won't break every update, sadly all configs from Mosey 1.X.X will no longer be supported.
